## 📘 Overview

**Text Data Analysis: YouTube Case Study** explores how language patterns in YouTube video titles, descriptions, and tags affect viewer engagement. Using Python and data analysis techniques, this project investigates how word choice, length, and sentiment correlate with performance metrics such as views, likes, and comments.

The work is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Youtube_data_analyst.ipynb`) as part of an applied data analytics portfolio project.

## 🧠 Key Insights

This case study reveals several text-driven patterns:

- **Title length** matters — concise, clear titles with emotionally charged words perform better.
- **Keywords** such as “official,” “tutorial,” and “review” increase visibility.
- **Positive sentiment** correlates with higher like-to-view ratios.
- **Hashtag and emoji usage** show mixed engagement results, depending on category.
- **Publishing day** and text tone together predict spikes in comment activity.

Visualizations include:

- Word Frequency and Word Cloud
- Sentiment Distribution of Titles
- Likes vs Views by Sentiment Polarity
- Average Engagement by Keyword Group
- Upload Frequency Over Time
