## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Text Data Analysis: YouTube Case Study** explores how language patterns in YouTube video titles, descriptions, and tags affect viewer engagement. Using Python and data analysis techniques, this project investigates how word choice, length, and sentiment correlate with performance metrics such as views, likes, and comments.

The work is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Youtube_data_analyst.ipynb`) as part of an applied data analytics portfolio project.
