# Text-Data-Analysis-YouTube-Case-Study
_Analyzing how text features influence engagement on YouTube_

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Text Data Analysis: YouTube Case Study** explores how language patterns in YouTube video titles, descriptions, and tags affect viewer engagement. Using Python and data analysis techniques, this project investigates how word choice, length, and sentiment correlate with performance metrics such as views, likes, and comments.

The work is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Youtube_data_analyst.ipynb`) as part of an applied data analytics portfolio project.

## Importing Required libariries and CSV file.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as p

comments = pd.read_csv(
    r"C:\Users\rocke\Downloads\Youtube_Data_Analysis\Dataset\UScomments.csv",
    on_bad_lines="skip"
)
```
## Finding and removing missing values
```python
comments.isnull().sum()
comments.dropna(inplace=True)
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
sentimen_scores=[]
for comment in comments["comment_text"]:
    score = sia.polarity_scores(str(comment))['compound']
    sentimen_scores.append(score)
sample_df = comments[0:10000]
comments["polarity"] = sentimen_scores
```

```
